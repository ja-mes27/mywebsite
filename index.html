                    <br><br>
                    I'm a man of many passions including, but not limited to; <a href="og.html" class="ee">music</a>, language learning, 3D design/printing, and most recently, coding. I live to learn new skills and challenge myself creatively at every opportunity.
                    <br><br>
                    I'm a multi-instrumentalist, with my best instrument being guitar, but I'm also proficient at the ukulele, drums, bass, piano and several others.
                    <br><br>
                    After around 3 years of self study I have reached conversational fluency in Japanese. I'm always looking to improve, so if you're up for a chat, 連絡してね！
                    <br><br>
                    I'm creating this site at the beginning of my coding journey. My goal is to become a fully-fledged software engineer, and I very much look forward to the challenges waiting between me and that goal!
