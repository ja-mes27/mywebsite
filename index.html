            <p>Thank you for checking out my website! Its still a work in progress, but I plan to keep updating it as my skills and achievements increase.
                <br><br>
                I'm a man of many passions including, but not limited to; music, language learning, 3D design/printing, and most recently, coding. I live to learn new skills and challenge myself creatively at every opportunity.
                <br><br>
                I'm a multi-instrumentalist, with my best instrument being guitar, but I'm also proficient at the ukulele, drums, bass, piano and several others.
                <br><br>
                After around 3 years of self study I have reached conversational fluency in Japanese. I'm always looking to improve, so if you're up for a chat, 連絡してね！
                <br><br>
                I'm creating this site at the beginning of my coding journey. My goal is to become a fully-fledged software engineer, and I very much look forward to the challenges waiting between me and that goal!
                <br><br>
