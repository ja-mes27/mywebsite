            <p>Thank you for checking out my website! Its still a work in progress, but I plan to keep updating it as my skills and achievements increase.
                <br><br>
                I'm a man of many passions, my main ones being music, language learning, learning new skills, and being creative however I can.
                <br><br>
                I'm a multi-instrumentalist, with my best instrument being guitar, but I also enjoy ukulele, drums, bass and a few others.
                <br><br>
                After around 3 years of self study I've reached a conversational fluency in Japanese. I'm always looking to improve, so if you're up for a chat, 連絡してね！
                <br><br>
                I'm creating this site at the beginning of my coding journey. I have hopes of becoming a software engineer, and I'm looking forward to the challenges waiting between me and that goal!
