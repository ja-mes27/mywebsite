        <div class="subflex"><article> I coded the aforementioned robot in Python. I controlled the robot with a Raspberry Pi that I loaded Linux onto. I would SSH to the PI from remote desktop to write the code. I mostly followed a tutorial that explained what to do, but not so much why I was doing it. I researched all the code to understand what it did and why it worked, and learned a lot. I also set up a home cloud server on another Raspberry Pi through similar means.</article></div>

        <div class="subflex"><article> I started learning HTML and CSS last week and I've learned a lot! I'm having great fun and I feel like I'm getting a good grasp of it. I initially learned from Net Ninja on youtube, and use W3 Schools for reference. I created this website from scratch without any templates. I've got work to do, especially in making it more responsive but I know where to go from here.</article></div>
